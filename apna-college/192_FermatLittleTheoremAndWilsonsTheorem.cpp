//Fermat Little Theorem
//if p is prime , then for integer a, number a**p - a is a multiple of p
//if a is not divisible by p, the a**(p-1) -1 is multiple of p

//Wilson's Theorem
// apositive integer n>1 is a prime if and only if (n-1)! is  congruent to -1 (mod n)
// or (n-1)! is congruent to (n-1) (mod n)
//or (n-1)! is 1 less than a multiple of n
